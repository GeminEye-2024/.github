# GeminEye - Gemini API Developer Competition

This project aims to assist seeing-impaired users by describing their surroundings and providing real-time location-based guidance using the Gemini API. The application allows users to prioritize what is verbalized based on their environment and integrates with the Google Maps API to offer accurate navigation and improve foot traffic data for Googleâ€™s algorithms.
